mapping_extra_id.py - file that does the reference resolution by creating a lookup dictionary for the ids used for creating TTL by the other code files.

parseStaticXML.py - reads static XML and creates a TTL for it.
python parseStaticXML.py -h 
- The above command on the terminal will show you the list of arguments needed.
1st is the static xml file
2nd is the static TTL location where you want to save it
3rd is the mapping dictionary pickle file (where the mappings of the ids are stored. PS: we get this by executing the file mapping_extra_id.py)


parseDynamicXML.py - reads dynamic XML and creates a TTL for it.
python parseDynamicXML.py -h 
- The above command on the terminal will show you the list of arguments needed.
1st is the dynamic xml file
2nd is the dynamic TTL location where you want to save it
3rd is the mapping dictionary pickle file 


parseCommentsXML.py - reads dynamic XML and creates a TTL for it.
python parseCommentsXML.py -h 
- The above command on the terminal will show you the list of arguments needed.
1st is the comments xml file
2nd is the comments TTL location where you want to save it
3rd is the mapping dictionary pickle file 


merge.py - reads all the three static, dynamic and comments TTL files and merges them into one.
So there are four arguments here :
1st - Static TTL
2nd - Dynamic TTL
3rd - Comments TTL
4th - Merged TTL location where you want to save it
