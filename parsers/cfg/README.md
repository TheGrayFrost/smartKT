# Source Level (Static) Control flow Graph

## BUILD
* cd cfg
* make

## RUN
* ./cfg <filename>.ast

# Algorithm Explanation


# Known Bugs
* Works on C++11 and below
* Do not use any header file that internally uses "stddef.h". Use C-style headers
  i.e. use specific headers for the functions, do not include a superset header file
  like bits/stdc++ or iostream
